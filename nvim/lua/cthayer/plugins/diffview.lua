-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- diffview.nvim (sindrets/diffview.nvim) — Git diff and merge conflict UI
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What it does: Opens a rich diff view for any git range, a file history panel
--   for blame-style exploration, and a 3-way merge conflict editor with layout
--   controls. Replaces the need for external diff tools during code review.
-- Keymaps:
--   <leader>gd  — diff working tree vs HEAD (DiffviewOpen)
--   <leader>gh  — file history for current buffer
--   <leader>gH  — file history for entire repo
--   <leader>gc  — close diffview (DiffviewClose)
-- Notes: Lazy-loaded on keymaps and commands; zero startup cost.
-- Depends on: nvim-web-devicons (icons), plenary.nvim (async).
